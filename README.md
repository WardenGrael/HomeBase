The beginning of the end.

Hello! 
My name is Kyne Gabriel A. de Leon.
My interests include Game design and Game testing, as well as 3d Modelling though I have Yet to start in any.
Video Games are what have held my interests ever since I was introduced to them by my father in the form of CS.
Therefore i would like to think I am above average in terms of the games I play but I am by no means a pro player.

My other hobbies include listening to music and reading manga and manhwa and watching anime from time to time.
I am very passionate about music though I can neither sing nor play music I love the way it adds volumes to scenes in music as well as animations.

I hope I can learn alot from my time as a Student in Computer Science.
